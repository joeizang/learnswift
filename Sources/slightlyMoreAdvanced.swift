// closures let us take lines of code and group it together to use elsewhere in our program.
// closures usually don't have names. they are functions without names and are not supposed to be run.
// they are to be passed around your code.
// so closures are passed to functions as parameters. They have curly braces so you would be passing the curly braces
// to the function as a parameter. the function would then run the closure.
// think of them like c# lambdas or javascript callback functions which are usally anonymized because they often are passed
// without a name.
